Thanks to many respectful guys/companies who made their tools or materials free or open source (KiCad, OpenSCAD, InkScape, Raspberry things).

## Caution
This is a difficult build. Much more difficult than my previous Pico Popn project: https://github.com/whowechina/popn_pico. Move forward only if you're REALLY interested.  
I'm still working on this documentation. If you see incomplete things, that's normal.

## HOW TO BUILD
